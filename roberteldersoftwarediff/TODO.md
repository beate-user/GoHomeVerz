This is a collection of ideas and thoughts that I haven't had time to implement, and I'll only pursue them if someone is legitimately interested in having them added.  In order to voice your opinion, file an issue against this repo.

roberteldersoftwarediff.py:

-  Ability to change ansi colours via command-line flags.
-  A JSON based interface so that an external tool could format the diff output as it pleased.
-  Improve the error messages around encoding conversion error messages.
-  Improve support for colour width on Windows powershell ISE.
-  Ability to ignore certain characters.
-  Improve unit tests by verifying output quantitatively.
-  Better asymptotic run-time performance that gets closer to unix diff without --minimal flag.
-  Implement better algorithm choices that optimize presenting diffs of code as opposed to random text.
